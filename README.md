## Introduction
This project was created as a summary of the "Python from scratch" course.
I have been interested in Artificial Intelligence for a long time, which is why I decided to create a small web application that will analyze the opinions entered by the user and indicate its sentiment. The internal code was written in Python, while Front-end part in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
